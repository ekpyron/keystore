This is a simple utility designed to be used with an ecryptfs
password storage.

It does the following:

It reads a configuration file from the user configuration directory
(default: ~/.config/keystore.conf) which contains a "path" variable.
(For syntax details have a look at libconfig
 at http://www.hyperrealm.com/libconfig/)

It then opens an "Open File" dialog with that path as default directory.
If a file is selected it reads the "password" variable from it and
prints it to stdout.

As a standalone program it's probably of no use to anyone :-).
